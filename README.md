## When use it?

When you want to retrieve information about the page pointed by the URL that your user has just copied, scrapinode is a great fit.
First scrapinode comes out of the box with a great feature of 1 line of code, that will give you the title, the description and the images of any HTML page on the web.
Second if you need more, you can extend it. See the examples to know more about it.

## Features

- Retrieve content like "title", "descriptions", "images", "videos" on any HTML pages with 1 line of code.
- Define specific operations based on the url of the page and the content you hope retrieve with regex.
- Scrape pages with jsdom + jquery or with cheerio.
- The HTTP client takes care to handle HTTP and HTML redirections.
- Scrape image like it was a HTML page.

## Install

```bash
npm install scrapinode
```

## Usage

```javascript
var scrapinode = require('scrapinode');

// Define an operation for a specific route and content
scrapinode.use('society6.com','title',function(window){
  var $ = window.$;
  var url = window.location.href; // url of the page maybe you want to check for some reasons
  var title = $('h1[itemprop="name"]').text();
  if(!title) return null;
  return title;
});

// Use default operations for content like "title", "descriptions", "images", "videos"
scrapinode.useAll(scrapinode.defaults());

scrapinode.createScraper('http://society6.com/product/Sounds-Good-Dude_T-shirt',function(err,scraper){
   if(err) return console.error(err);
   var title = scraper.get('title');
   console.log(title); // "Sound Good dude"
});
